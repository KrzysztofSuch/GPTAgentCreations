## Calculator

This repository includes a simple command-line calculator written in Python.

### Usage

Run the script with Python 3 and follow the prompts:

```bash
python calculator.py
```

Enter expressions such as `2 + 3 * 4` or `10 / 3`. Type `quit` or `exit` to end the program.

You can also evaluate a single expression directly:

```bash
python calculator.py "3 + 5"
```

No additional dependencies are required beyond the Python standard library.
