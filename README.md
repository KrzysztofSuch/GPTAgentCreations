## Calculator

This repository includes a simple command-line calculator written in C#.

### Usage

Build and run the program using the .NET SDK:

```bash
dotnet run -- "3 + 5"
```

If no expression is provided as arguments, the calculator starts in interactive mode. Enter expressions such as `2 + 3 * 4` or `10 / 3` and type `quit` or `exit` to end the program.
